=======
Hardware Abstraction Layer for AVR microcontrollers and common boards (for example Arduino).  Based on the [`avr-device`](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-device) crate.

**This is a new version of `avr-hal`!  Older versions can be found in the `old` branch but will no longer get support.**

## Quickstart
You need a nightly Rust compiler for compiling Rust code for AVR.  **Note**: Due to a regression, versions after `nightly-2021-01-07` are currently broken (see [#124](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/issues/124)).  Please use that version of the compiler for now. The correct version will be installed automatically.

On Ubuntu, you'll need to install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install avr-libc gcc-avr pkg-config avrdude
```

Next, install ["ravedude"](./ravedude), a tool which seamlessly integrates flashing your board into the usual cargo workflow:

```bash
cargo +stable install ravedude
```

Go into `./examples/arduino-uno` (or the directory for whatever board you want), and run the following commands:

```bash
cd examples/arduino-uno

# Build and run it on a connected board
cargo run --bin uno-blink
```

## Starting your own project
The best way to start your own project is via the [`avr-hal-template`](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal-template) which you can easily use with [`cargo-generate`](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate):

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo generate --git https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal-template.git
```

## Repository Structure
The `avr-hal` repository is a workspace containing all components making up the HAL.  Here is an overview:

### `arduino-hal` [![arduino-hal docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-git-4d76ae)][arduino-hal docs]
`arduino-hal` is the batteries-included HAL for all Arduino & similar boards.  This is what you probably want to use for your projects.  It is intentionally built to abstract away the differences between boards as much as possible.

### `examples/*`
The [examples directory](./examples) contains lots of examples for common hardware.  Do note that not all examples were ported to all boards, but there is a good chance that you can still use the code.  Currently, the [Arduino Uno](./examples/arduino-uno/) crate contains the most examples.

### `mcu/atmega-hal` [![atmega-hal docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-git-4d76ae)][atmega-hal docs] , `mcu/attiny-hal` [![attiny-hal docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-git-4d76ae)][attiny-hal docs]
HAL crates for AVR microcontroller families.  If you have a custom board, you'll want to work with these crates.  Please check their documentation for a list of supported MCUs.

### `avr-hal-generic` [![avr-hal-generic docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-git-4d76ae)][avr-hal-generic docs]
This is a generic crate containing most of the HAL implementaions in the form of macros which are instanciated in each HAL crate for the specific MCUs.  If you intend to write drivers that work with any AVR chip, targeting `avr-hal-generic` is probably the best route.

### `avr-specs/`
The `avr-specs/` directory contains rustc target definitions for all supported microcontrollers.  You will need these for compiling rust code for AVR.  The [`avr-hal-template`](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal-template) already includes them for convenience.

### [`ravedude`](./ravedude) [![crates.io page](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/ravedude.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/ravedude)
`ravedude` is a utility for seamlessly integrating avrdude and a serial console into the cargo workflow.  With a bit of configuration (check its [README](./ravedude/README.md)!) you can then upload your code to your board and view its output over the serial console by just using `cargo run` as you would normally.
