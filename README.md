avr-hal [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Rahix/avr-hal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Rahix/avr-hal)
=======

## Quickstart
You need nightly rust for compiling rust code for AVR.  Go into `./boards/arduino-leonardo` (or the directory for whatever board you want), and run the following commands:
```bash
cd boards/arduino-leonardo

# Now you are ready to build your first avr blink example!
cargo +nightly build --example leonardo-blink

# For some boards, you can even run it directly (this will attempt to flash it
# onto a connected board):
cargo +nightly run --example leonardo-blink

# For others, you can find the binary file in
ls ../../target/avr-atmega32u4/debug/examples/leonardo-blink.elf
# and e.g. create an ihex file using
avr-objcopy -S -j .text -j .data -O ihex leonardo-blink.elf leonardo-blink.hex
```

## Starting your own project
This is a step-by-step guide for creating a new project targeting Arduino Leonardo (`ATmega32U4`).  You can of course apply the same steps for any other microcontroller.

1. Start by creating a new project:
   ```bash
   cargo new --bin avr-example
   cd avr-example
   ```
2. If you're using rustup, you probably want to set an override for this directory, to use the nightly toolchain:
   ```bash
   rustup override set nightly
   ```
3. Copy the target description for your MCU (e.g. [`avr-atmega32u4.json`](avr-specs/avr-atmega32u4.json)) into your project.
4. Create a file `.cargo/config.toml` with the following content:
   ```toml
   [build]
   target = "avr-atmega32u4.json"

   [unstable]
   build-std = ["core"]
   ```
5. Fill `Cargo.toml` with these additional directives:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   # A panic handler is needed.  This is a crate with the most basic one.
   # The `leonardo-panic` example shows a more elaborate version.
   panic-halt = "0.2.0"

   [dependencies.arduino-leonardo]
   git = "https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal"
   rev = "<insert latest git-commit hash here>"
   # ^- Pin the dependency to a specific version.  You should use the latest
   # commit hash from the avr-hal master branch.  You can find it here:
   #
   #    https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/commits/master

   # Configure the build for minimal size
   [profile.dev]
   panic = "abort"
   lto = true
   opt-level = "s"

   [profile.release]
   panic = "abort"
   codegen-units = 1
   debug = true
   lto = true
   opt-level = "s"
   ```
   **Note**: If you at some point want to update to a newer version of `avr-hal`, you just need to put a later commit hash into the `rev =` field.  For any breaking changes which might require you to fix something in your code, read the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
6. Start your project with this basic template:
   ```rust
   #![no_std]
   #![no_main]

   // Pull in the panic handler from panic-halt
   extern crate panic_halt;

   use arduino_leonardo::prelude::*;

   #[arduino_leonardo::entry]
   fn main() -> ! {
       let dp = arduino_leonardo::Peripherals::take().unwrap();

       unimplemented!()
   }
   ```
7. Build with these commands (make sure you're using _nightly_ rust!):
   ```bash
   cargo build
   # or
   cargo build --release
   ```
   and find your binary in `target/avr-atmega32u4/debug/` (or `target/avr-atmega32u4/release`).

8. (**Optional**): To make development as smooth as possible, you can configure a cargo runner for your board.  This repository contains a few example scripts (e.g. [`leonardo-runner.sh`][leonardo-runner], [`uno-runner.sh`][uno-runner]) which you can copy into your project.  You'll then need to add the following section to your `.cargo/config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [target.'cfg(target_arch = "avr")']
   runner = "./leonardo-runner.sh"
   ```
   And that's it, now you can build an run your project in a single command!
   ```bash
   cargo run
   # or
   cargo run --release
   ```

[leonardo-runner]: ./boards/arduino-leonardo/leonardo-runner.sh
[uno-runner]: ./boards/arduino-uno/uno-runner.sh

## Repository Structure
This repository contains the following components:
* A generic crate containing implementations that can be used chip-independently and macros to create chip-dependent instances of peripheral abstractions.  This crate is named [`avr-hal-generic`](./avr-hal-generic).
* HAL crates for each MCU in `chips/`.  These make use of `avr-hal-generic` to create chip-specific definitions.
* Board Support Crates for popular hardware in `boards/`.  They, for the most part, just re-export functionality from the chip-HAL, with the names that are printed on the PCB.
