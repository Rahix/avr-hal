# Because this crate has its own check that at least one device is selected, we
# can safely "circumvent" the check in `avr-device`.
#
# Why would we want that?  Otherwise, as `avr-device` is compiled first, its
# error will be shown and ours won't which leads to a degraded user experience
# as the displayed error message does not really tell what needs to be done...
