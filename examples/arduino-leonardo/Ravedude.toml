# The Arduino Leonardo does not have a UART console like other Arduino boards.
# Instead, it can emulate a console device over USB, but this is not yet
# supported in `avr-hal`.  To get console output from an Arduino Leonardo, you
# need to connect an external usb-serial converter to the TX/RX pins of your
# board.
