/*!
 * Sweep a standard SG90 compatible servo from its left limit all the way to its right limit.
 *
 * Because avr-hal does not have a dedicated servo driver library yet, we do this manually using
 * timer TC1.  The servo should be connected to D9 (AND D9 ONLY!  THIS DOES NOT WORK ON OTHER PINS
 * AS IT IS).
 *
 * As the limits are not precisely defined, we undershoot the datasheets 1ms left limit and
 * overshoot the 2ms right limit by a bit - you can figure out where exactly the limits are for
 * your model by experimentation.
 *
 * Connections
 * -----------
 *  - `D9`: Servo's PWM signal
